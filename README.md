# projectARL

This repository contains multiple projects centered around my learning of Front-End Development Frameworks at ARL, specifically React frameworks (for the majority of my projects).
 
## Apples-Bananas

### Overview
Apples-Bananas was the very first project that I worked on. It is a straightforward HTML, CSS, and JavaScript program that lets a user pick apples or bananas, enter their name, and the website will reveal which fruit they like. It took me about three days to complete this using GitHub pages. 

**If you want to look at the finished website, here is the URL: https://codygima.github.io/apples-bananas/**

### Installation
To install Apples-Bananas, open your local terminal and run the following commands:

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codygima/projectARL.git
```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
```bash
cd projectARL/apples-bananas-main
```
3. Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
### Usage
To use this program, install and open Visual Studio Code, then follow these steps:

1. Install the Live Server extension by Ritwick Dey from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
2. Locate the projectARL folder and open the `apples-bananas-main` folder
3. Right-click on `index.html` in the Explorer panel.
4. Select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu.
5. Your default browser should then open the project on a live server that updates in real-time.

## React To-Do List

### Overview
This is the first of many to-do lists within this repository. I created this to-do list using exclusively React plus Vite. The code is relatively simple with implementations of React. This website is primarily written in JSX (JavaScript + XML) and CSS. I watched [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh3tobg7hEo) for a basic tutorial and understanding of React.

**If you want to look at the finished website, here is the URL: https://codygima.github.io/toDoList-project/**

### Installation and Usage
To install React To-Do List, open your local terminal and run the following commands:

1. Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codygima/projectARL.git
```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
```bash
cd projectARL/toDoList-project
```
3. Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Install Vite:
```bash
npm install -D vite
```
5. Run It:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Installing Vite and running it should allow a live server for this website and can show changes in real-time.
